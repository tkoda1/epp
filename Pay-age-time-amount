# This code shows how to (1) import a csv file
# and (2) run logistic regression

# importing data into R

# First make sure R is reading from the correct directory
# What is your current directory? Use this command:
getwd()

# Change your directory, use setwd("<directory path here>")
# Note: The path in the line below will NOT work for you

# what files are in this directory? Use this:
list.files()
# if your data files are not in that list, either you're in
# the wrong directory or you don't have the data in the 
# right place

# Read in a csv file (should end with ".csv"), use this:
cFraud <- read.csv("creditCardTransactions (1).csv")

# Look at the first 6 rows using this:
head(cFraud)

# learn more about the data using this:
str(cFraud)

# How many c-sections where there?
table(cFraud$age)

# What is the mean age?
mean(cFraud$age)

# What does this do?
summary(cFraud$age)

# What does this do?
table(cFraud$us_citizen, cFraud$age)

# split data into a training set and a test set

# make sure you get the same random numbers each time you run
set.seed(1234)

# choose random rows
testIndexC <- sample(dim(cFraud)[1], size = 500, replace = FALSE)

# put those rows into a dataset
testDC <- cFraud[testIndexC,]

# put all other rows into a dataset
trainDC <- cFraud[-testIndexC,]

# Logistic Regression

# Estimate the parameters for the logistic regression model
cFraudFit <- glm(fraud_detected ~ age + as.factor(payment_cat) + transac_time + transac_amount, data = trainDC, family = "binomial")

# show output
summary(cFraudFit)

# calculate confidence intervals
confint(cFraudFit)

# This function takes the output from glm
# Outputs a readable table
logTable <- function(fit){
  sumry <- summary(fit)
  oddsRatios <- exp(sumry$coefficients[,1])
  confInts <- exp(confint(fit))
  pvals <- sumry$coefficients[,4]
  return(cbind(oddsRatios, confInts, pvals))
}

# show output
logTable(cFraudFit)

# how do we interpret this table?

# make predictions for test data about c-sections
cFraudProb <- predict(cFraudFit, newdata = testDC, type = "response")

# output predictions, they're probabilities of a c-section
cFraudProb

# if the probability > 0.5, we're going to predict a Fruad, otherwise no
cFraudPred <- ifelse(cFraudProb > 0.5, 1, 0)

# take a side-by-side look
cbind(cFraudProb, cFraudPred)

# how does this compare to the actual values?
# look at all the values
cbind(cFraudPred, testDC$fraud_detected)

# look at a table
table(cFraudPred, testDC$fraud_detected)

# error rate
sum(cFraudPred != testDC$fraud_detected)/length(cFraudPred)
